The purpose of this database is to allow academic researchers to share information about their research and professional trajectories with the public through a centralized resource in order to illuminate the web of connections that exist across academic disciplines and scholarly publishing.

Key Objectives:
- Provide a centralized resource for information about academic researchers and the ways their work intersects and interacts with one another through areas of study, the publications they may have made, and the multi-modal ways in which they are connected to various institutions. 
- Allow users to search and discover various the variety of connections in academic research, including but not limited to: 
    - Forms of funding and how it connects to other researchers or institutions (e.g. Jill and Joseph McKinstry Libraries Endowed Fellowship, which is connected to the University of Washington and multiple researchers who have been recipients). 
    - Position holders, past and present (e.g. a list of all visiting faculty at the University of Washington iSchool or all Associate Deans of Academics at any institution).
    - All researchers interested in a specific subject area or general research area. 
    - Allow users to generate descriptive reports to analyze and/or track aspects of academic research, publishing, and institutional affiliations. 
    - Allow users to track academic research trends and discussions through a variety of publication methods (e.g. traditional and nontraditional scholarly publications).
    - Allow users to search and track recognitions across researchers, disciplines, and institutions.
